    <h1>How to Play Simon Game</h1>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The objective of the Simon game is to repeat the sequence of colors that Simon shows. As you progress, the sequence becomes longer and faster, testing your memory and concentration skills.</p>
    
    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Starting the Game:</strong> When you start the game, Simon will randomly flash one or more colors. You will need to remember the sequence of colors.</li>
      <li><strong>Following the Sequence:</strong> After the initial sequence is displayed, you must click on the same colors in the same order. Each correct sequence will add one more color to the pattern.</li>
      <li><strong>Your Task:</strong> Pay close attention as the sequence gets longer. The game will add a new color to the pattern after every correct round.</li>
      <li><strong>Losing the Game:</strong> If you make a mistake, the game will show a "Game Over" message and display your score (the number of sequences you successfully repeated). You can press Restart to play again from the beginning.</li>
      <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Your score is based on how many sequences you can correctly repeat without errors. The longer the sequence, the more difficult the game becomes.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Tips to Win:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Pay close attention to the sequence of colors.</li>
      <li><strong>Practice:</strong> The more you play, the better you will get at remembering the patterns.</li>
      <li><strong>Stay Calm:</strong> Try to stay relaxed and confident as the sequence becomes longer.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Good Luck!</h2>
    <p>May your memory be sharp, and may you go as far as possible!</p>
